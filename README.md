# Find My Car
Find my car is a simple and free Android app that allows you to save the location of your car to a list of favorites. You can then navigate back to it using Google Maps. Never get lost in a big parking lot again. Additionally, the app also displays your current latitude and longitude as you move around. 

The app is very simple and only consists of three buttons; Map which shows you where you currently are, save parking location to save where you parked and navigate to car which uses Google maps to take you to your parked car. 
It is built using Android studio and Android SDK version 28. 

Last of all, Enjoy!
